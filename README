Minimalog is a blogging application created with django for the app engine infrastructure.

Inspired by: http://bret.appspot.com/entry/experimenting-google-app-engine

It was created more by whim than by need: I wanted to design a minimalist blog and host it in appengine in an afternoon; and customizing the other appengine-ready blogging engines wasn't the way to go. As an intermediate django developer, I realized that my goal could be met if I created just a minimum viable solution, and expand it when needed.

It's also a proof of concept: to determine how much of the standard blog parafernalia is pure accesory, and how much actuallyaids in the only goal of such an application: to get information.

Feel free to contribute or tell me what is lacking and what I could do away with.
